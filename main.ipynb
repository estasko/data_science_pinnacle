    "We are interested in exploring what combination of the collected features best predicts whether an individual has diabetes. Given these inputs, we want to determine whether we can create a model to predict this accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team will use the Healthcare Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle. Each instance represents various aspects of an individual’s health data and their diagnosis or non-diagnosis of diabetes. It was last updated in 2023, meaning the data is recent and relevant. The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). There are 2,768 patients included in the data, with 10 features recorded. Each instance represents a unique individual with recorded features listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\t**Id**: Unique identifier for each data entry.\n",
    "2. **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant. (Includes people who cannot get pregnant).\n",
    "4.\t**Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.\n",
    "5.\t**BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).\n",
    "6.\t**SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm). Indicator of body fat distribution.\n",
    "7.\t**Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).\n",
    "8.\t**BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg / height in m^2).\n",
    "9.\t**DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function, a genetic score of diabetes.\n",
    "10.\t**Age**: Age in years.\n",
    "11.\t**Outcome**: Binary classification indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Features we are particularly interested in to predict whether the individual has diabetes are glucose, diabetes pedigree function, and insulin features. We are surprised by the skin thickness and intrigued to determine whether this has any predictive value. "

This becomes hard to interpret as the data -nor its metadata file / documentation- do not specify sex and thus may include patients unable to have children. This might jepordize the valididity of using this feature. Alternatively, as sex is not a feature of this dataset it may not impact diabetes outcome. Thus, pregnancy impact on diabetes outcome could easily be determine by pregnancy or no pregnancy - where a person with or without the ability to get pregnant, who has not been pregrnant, has the same chance of a positive outcome. Regardless, we will perform further analysis of this feature. \n",

    "All features have a significant p-value. While only the means of Glucose and Insulin are drastically different, because the sample sizes are all large it creates large test statistics and small p-values. P-Values are often ignored in clinical work because it is more clinically relevant to look at the magnitude of the difference of the relevant metric. With a large enough sample size even small changes that are not clinically relevant could be statistially significant. As seen above the mean difference of Blood Pressure between patients with and without diabetes is ~4.6; while this is statistically significant, a difference in Blood Pressure of 4.6mmHg is not clinically relevant. However we can not anticipate which features will be the  useful in predicting diabetes using this information.

    "The Random Forests confusion matrix shows much improvement from the logistic regression model. It correctly predicted non-diabetics 98.6% of the time, and diabetics 98.1% of the time. This shows significant improvement in the model and promise that diabetes diagnosis can be predicted by useful known health factors. The model’s strong accuracy in both categories suggests it could be a valuable tool in early detection and prevention strategies for at-risk populations."

    "Our project aims to explore if we can predict diabetes diagnoses with known health data, via multiple machine learnign models. We explored parametric and non parametric methods: logistic regression, Random Forests, and XGBoost. Useful factors from our data includes glucose levels, BMI, age, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and number of pregnancies. A sub-analysis identified a positive association between the number of pregnancies and diabetes diagnosis, as well as an inclusive finding that considering those who have never been pregnant or cannot become pregnant was still informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first modelling method used was logistic regression, a non-parametric method for binary, categorical outcome variables. This model showed decent accuracy, predicting correctly 77.3% of the time. However, upon further analysis, this model only correctly predicted those without diabetes, and had a high false negative rate of 47.4%. This model would miss almost half of diabetic patients, which could have severe consequences in a medical setting when early intervention, treatment, and diagnosis can impact a patient's wellbeing and quality of life. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second model used was Random Forests, which improved upon the accuracy of the logistic regression model to 98.5%. Upon further analysis of the confusion matrix, the model had significant improvement with the false negative rates remaining of 1.9%. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third model used was XGBoost, which is a more compelx model, however it did not yield a higher accuracy, remaining at 98.5%. The confusion matrix shows a similar trend, with the false positive rate being equivalent to the 1.9% of the Random Forests model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these models demonstrated the potential of using known health features to accurately predict diabetes in patients, showing promise as a tool for early detection and prevention strategies to improve the quality of life for diabetic patients. "

    "The first major limitation is the amount of missing values in the 2-hour serum Insulin column in our data set. This required us to eliminate it as a potential predictive feature, which could have improved the model. In addition, the pregnancy column does not discriminate between those who cnnot get pregnant with those who can, resulting in an over reporting of zero pregnancies, therefore potentially skewing the relationship between diabetes and pregnancies, which required an additional sub analysis. Lastly, future research should also focus on improving data quality by minimizing missing values for critical features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, this data set does not include socioeconomic factors, which we know can be highly associated with diabetes in patients. Factors like sex, race, income, and housing status could all impact the predictive ability of a model for diabetes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the data set has a high sample size which creates large test statistics and small p-values, which can potentially inflate the statistical significance of the difference of groups in the two sample t-tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, using machine learning as a predictive tool in diagnostic techniques is still heavily debated in the medical field. Our project highlights the limitations of model building, where the potential for missed diagnoses is high. \n",
    "\n",
    "Future recommendations include increasing the number of socioeconomic factors recorded for each patient, and explore other clinical study types to best explore the diagnosis. A cohort study would provide more perspective to the features that impact diabetes by providing a timeframe of when a patient was diagnosed with diabetes, and may illude to what features changed leading to that diagnosis\n",
